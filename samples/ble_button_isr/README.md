# Sample ble_button_isr
## About the project

The aim of this application is to see a variable change in a BLE communication. The application is based on the zephyr application in `zephyr/samples/bluetooth/peripheral_ht`. The contribution of this application is to send an other information via BLE, and use button's interruptions.

## Expected behaviour

The behavior expected by the program is as follows: a single button0 press will toggle the flag value, between 0 and 1, and send it trough BLE communication. This sample doesn't use the `ble_lib` developped for the OPEN project.
