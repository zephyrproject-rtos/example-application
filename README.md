# Zephyr Example Application

This repository is based off of the zephyr example application repo https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/example-application.
This repository has the following added feature.

- Docker container to manage and isolate your workspace
- west autocomplete

# Zephyr Example Application

This repository contains a Zephyr example application. The main purpose of this
repository is to serve as a reference on how to structure Zephyr-based
applications. Some of the features demonstrated in this example are:

- Basic [Zephyr application][app_dev] skeleton
- [Zephyr workspace applications][workspace_app]
- [Zephyr modules][modules]
- [West T2 topology][west_t2]
- [Custom boards][board_porting]
- Custom [devicetree bindings][bindings]
- Out-of-tree [drivers][drivers]
- Out-of-tree libraries
- Example CI configuration (using Github Actions)
- Custom [west extension][west_ext]

This repository is versioned together with the [Zephyr main tree][zephyr]. This
means that every time that Zephyr is tagged, this repository is tagged as well
with the same version number, and the [manifest](west.yml) entry for `zephyr`
will point to the corresponding Zephyr tag. For example, the `example-application`
v2.6.0 will point to Zephyr v2.6.0. Note that the `main` branch always
points to the development branch of Zephyr, also `main`.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure you have a proper Zephyr development
environment. Follow the official
[Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html).

### Initialization

1. Install docker and docker-compose. Follow the installation guide at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.

2. Install the "Dev Containers" extension in vscode.

3. Open this repository in vscode. Select the blue icon in the lower left corner and select "Reopen in Container" from the menu.



### Building and running

To build the application, run the following command:

```shell
west build -b $BOARD app
```

where `$BOARD` is the target board.

You can use the `custom_plank` board found in this
repository. Note that Zephyr sample boards may be used if an
appropriate overlay is provided (see `app/boards`).

A sample debug configuration is also provided. To apply it, run the following
command:

```shell
west build -b $BOARD app -- -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=debug.conf
```

Once you have built the application, run the following command to flash it:

```shell
west flash
```
